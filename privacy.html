            <p>
                We use cookies and similar technologies to enhance your experience, remember your preferences, and
                understand how visitors interact with our website. You can manage your cookie preferences at any time
                by clicking "Cookie Preferences" in the footer or by using our

            <h3>Types of Cookies We Use</h3>

            <h4>Strictly Necessary (Always Active)</h4>
            <p>
                These are essential for the website to function properly. They include authentication tokens for
                secure access, security tokens to protect against attacks, and consent preferences to remember your
                cookie choices. These cannot be disabled as they are required for basic site functionality.
            </p>

            <h4>Analytics &amp; Performance</h4>
            <p>
                With your consent, we use Vercel Web Analytics to understand how visitors interact with our website.
                This helps us improve user experience and site performance. Vercel Analytics is privacy-focused and
                does not use cookies that track you across other websites. Data collected includes page views, device
                type, and general performance metrics. No personally identifiable information is collected by analytics.
            </p>

            </ul>

            <h4>Functional</h4>
            <p>
                With your consent, we store preferences like your dashboard layout settings and theme choices in
                your browser's local storage. This data stays on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.
            </p>

            <h4>Marketing &amp; Advertising</h4>
            <p>
                We do not currently use marketing or advertising cookies. If we introduce these in the future, we
                will update this policy and request your consent.
            </p>
