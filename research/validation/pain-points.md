## The Core Insight

**People know creatine works. They just don't take it consistently.**

Why? Friction.

## Friction Map

### Standard Creatine Experience

```
Wake up
    ↓
Remember to take creatine (FRICTION: cognitive load)
    ↓
Find the container (FRICTION: added step)
    ↓
Get a glass/shaker (FRICTION: another item)
    ↓
Measure powder (FRICTION: precision needed)
    ↓
Add water/liquid (FRICTION: choice paralysis)
    ↓
Stir/shake (FRICTION: 30-60 seconds, effort)
    ↓
Deal with clumps/grit (FRICTION: unpleasant)
    ↓
Drink it down (FRICTION: separate moment)
    ↓
Clean the shaker (FRICTION: adds to dishes)
    ↓
Finally: actual morning begins
```

**Total friction points: 10**
**Total added time: 3-5 minutes**
**Mental load: Medium-high**

### FUSE Experience

```
Wake up
    ↓
Make coffee (already doing this)
    ↓
Add FUSE scoop (1 motion, 2 seconds)
    ↓
Drink coffee
    ↓
Done. Creatine handled.
```

**Total friction points: 1 (barely)**
**Total added time: 2 seconds**
**Mental load: Zero**

## Documented Pain Points

### Category 1: The Forgetting Problem

> "I bought creatine six months ago. It's still mostly full. I just forget to take it."

**Frequency:** Universal
**Root cause:** Not attached to existing habit
**FUSE solution:** Attachment to coffee = automatic

### Category 2: The Taste/Texture Problem

> "Creatine in water is gritty and gross. I stopped because I hated the texture."

**Frequency:** Very common
**Root cause:** Poor solubility, large particles
**FUSE solution:** Micro-encapsulation = instant dissolve, no grit

### Category 3: The Timing Confusion

> "When am I supposed to take it? Before workout? After? Morning? Does it matter?"

**Frequency:** Common (especially beginners)
**Root cause:** Conflicting information online
**FUSE solution:** "Take it with your morning coffee. Done. Timing doesn't matter for creatine—consistency does."

### Category 4: The Extra Step Problem

> "I already take three supplements. Adding another powder ritual is too much."

**Frequency:** Common in health-conscious people
**Root cause:** Supplement fatigue
**FUSE solution:** No new ritual. Existing habit. Zero steps added.

### Category 5: The Travel Problem

> "I skip creatine when traveling because I don't want to pack a shaker."

**Frequency:** Moderate
**Root cause:** Gear requirement
**FUSE solution:** Single-serve sachets. Any coffee. Anywhere.

### Category 6: The Social Friction

> "I don't want to be that person mixing powder at the office."

**Frequency:** Moderate
**Root cause:** Supplement stigma
**FUSE solution:** Looks like sugar/sweetener. No one knows. No judgment.

## Quantifying the Pain

### Survey Questions (To Deploy)

1. "How often do you actually take creatine?" (Daily / Most days / Sometimes / Rarely / Bought but don't take)

2. "What's your biggest barrier to consistent supplementation?"
   - Forgetting
   - Taste/texture
   - Too many steps
   - Cost
   - Confusion about timing
   - Other

3. "If you could add a supplement to your coffee without changing the taste, would you?" (Definitely / Probably / Maybe / Probably not / Definitely not)

4. "How many supplements have you bought but stopped taking?" (0 / 1-2 / 3-5 / 5+)

| Grit/texture | "Watch it disappear. 3 seconds. No stirring." | Video |
| Timing confusion | "Morning coffee. That's it. That's the protocol." | Thread |
| Extra steps | "You already drink coffee. We just made it smarter." | Story |
| Travel | "Single serve. Any coffee. Anywhere in the world." | Product feature |
| Social friction | "Looks like sugar. Works like science." | Clever copy |

## Competitive Pain Comparison

| Solution | Friction Score | Why |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| Standard powder + shaker | 8/10 | Multiple steps, cleaning, taste |
| Creatine capsules | 5/10 | Swallowing pills, large quantities |
| Pre-workout with creatine | 6/10 | Only pre-workout, stimulant timing |
| Creatine gummies | 4/10 | Expensive, childish, sugar |
| **FUSE** | 1/10 | Attaches to existing habit |
