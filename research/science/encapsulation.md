# Micro-Encapsulation Technology

> The core innovation: protecting creatine monohydrate through thermal and acidic environments while enabling instant dissolution.

## The Problem

Standard creatine monohydrate in hot coffee:
- **Clumps** at the surface (hydrophobic shell formation)
- **Gritty texture** persists (incomplete dissolution)
- **Thermal degradation** potential (creatine → creatinine conversion)
- **Acidic environment** stress (coffee pH 4.5-6.0)
- **Stirring required** for 30-60 seconds minimum

## The Solution: Triple Shield Technology

### Layer 1: Thermal Protection Shell
- **Material candidates:** Modified starch, maltodextrin, gum arabic
- **Function:** Creates heat barrier up to 100°C
- **Dissolve trigger:** Designed to release at specific temp threshold
- **Research priority:** Identify optimal coating that protects but releases

### Layer 2: pH Buffer Micro-Layer
- **Function:** Neutralizes local acidity during dissolution
- **Prevents:** Creatine-to-creatinine degradation pathway
- **Duration:** Active for 10-15 seconds (dissolution window)

### Layer 3: Rapid-Release Core
- **Particle size:** <50 microns (instant dispersion)
- **Surface treatment:** Hydrophilic coating for water attraction
- **Result:** Draws liquid in, releases payload, disperses

## Key Encapsulation Methods to Evaluate

### 1. Spray Drying
- **Pros:** Scalable, cost-effective, industry standard
- **Cons:** Heat exposure during process, particle size limits
- **Viability:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High

### 2. Coacervation
- **Pros:** Lower temps, excellent coating control
- **Cons:** More expensive, complex scaling
- **Viability:** ⭐⭐⭐ Medium-High

### 3. Fluidized Bed Coating
- **Pros:** Precise layer control, proven for supplements
- **Cons:** Equipment cost, batch size constraints
- **Viability:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High

### 4. Liposomal Encapsulation
- **Pros:** Superior bioavailability, gentle process
- **Cons:** Expensive, stability questions in heat
- **Viability:** ⭐⭐ Low (for MVP)

## Testing Protocol (Pre-Supplier)

### Bench Test 1: Heat Stability
1. Prepare creatine samples (encapsulated vs raw)
2. Add to 90°C water, hold for 5 minutes
3. Cool, send for HPLC analysis
4. Compare creatine recovery rates

### Bench Test 2: Dissolution Time
1. Video setup: clear mug, overhead camera, timer overlay
2. Pour 200ml coffee at 85°C
3. Add measured dose (5g)
4. Record until fully dissolved (visual confirmation)
5. Log: time, residue, surface behavior

### Bench Test 3: Taste Panel
1. Blind test: coffee with/without FUSE
2. Panel: 10 regular coffee drinkers
3. Metrics: taste change detection, texture, aftertaste
4. Target: <20% detection rate

## Current Questions

- [ ] What's the minimum coating thickness for thermal protection?
- [ ] Can we achieve <3s dissolution at both 75°C and 95°C?
- [ ] Does the coating add measurable calories?
- [ ] What's the shelf life impact of encapsulation?
- [ ] MOQ requirements from UK manufacturers?
