# Creatine Stability Research

> Understanding how creatine monohydrate behaves in hot, acidic environments—and how to protect it.

## The Chemistry

### Creatine Monohydrate (C₄H₉N₃O₂·H₂O)
- **Molecular weight:** 149.15 g/mol
- **Solubility:** ~16g/L at 20°C, increases with temperature
- **pH stability:** Most stable at pH 6.5-7.5
- **Thermal sensitivity:** Degradation accelerates above 60°C

### Degradation Pathway
```
Creatine (active) → Creatinine (inactive) + H₂O

Factors accelerating conversion:
- Heat (exponential above 60°C)
- Low pH (<5.0)
- Time in solution
- Presence of certain ions
```

## Coffee Environment Analysis

### Typical Coffee Parameters
| Factor | Range | Risk Level |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Temperature | 60-95°C | 🔴 High |
| pH | 4.5-6.0 | 🟡 Medium |
| Brew time exposure | 3-10 min drinking | 🟡 Medium |
| Ionic content | Varies by water | 🟢 Low |

### The Good News
- Coffee is consumed within 10-15 minutes typically
- Creatine doesn't need to survive hours—just minutes
- Encapsulation can delay exposure until lower temps
- Faster dissolution = less time in harsh environment

## Key Studies

### Study 1: Jäger et al. (2011)
- **Finding:** Creatine in solution at pH 3.5 showed 4.4% degradation over 8 hours
- **Implication:** Coffee's 10-minute window is safe at typical acidity
- **Citation:** ISSN position stand on creatine supplementation

### Study 2: Dash et al. (2002)
- **Finding:** At 90°C and pH 6.0, <2% creatine loss after 30 minutes
- **Implication:** Temperature alone isn't catastrophic short-term
- **Citation:** Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences

### Study 3: Persky et al. (2003)
- **Finding:** Creatine bioavailability unaffected by gastric acid exposure
- **Implication:** If stomach acid doesn't destroy it, coffee won't either
- **Citation:** Creatine in Health and Disease

## FUSE-Specific Stability Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Baseline (Raw Creatine)
1. Add 5g raw creatine to fresh coffee (85°C)
2. Sample at: 0, 5, 10, 15, 30 minutes
3. HPLC analysis for creatine:creatinine ratio
4. Establish degradation curve

### Phase 2: Encapsulated Comparison
1. Repeat with encapsulated formulation
2. Same timepoints
3. Compare curves
4. Calculate protection factor

### Phase 3: Real-World Simulation
1. Test across coffee types (espresso, drip, cold brew)
2. Test at consumption temperatures (60°C, 70°C, 80°C)
3. Test with additives (milk, sugar, oat milk)
4. Document any interactions

## Expected Outcomes

Based on literature review:
- **Raw creatine in hot coffee:** 95-98% intact after 10 minutes
- **Encapsulated creatine:** 99%+ intact (delayed release)
- **After consumption:** Near-total bioavailability

The science supports the concept. The encapsulation is primarily for **user experience** (no clumps, instant dissolve) rather than stability protection—which is actually a stronger position.

## Talking Points for Content

> "Creatine is one of the most stable supplements on Earth. It survives your stomach acid. It survives being stored for years. Coffee is a gentle environment by comparison. The encapsulation isn't about protection—it's about experience. Zero grit. Zero stirring. Just pour and go."

## Open Research Questions

- [ ] Does adding milk change the degradation profile?
- [ ] Is cold brew (lower acidity) measurably better?
- [ ] Do specific coffee origins affect stability?
- [ ] Can we achieve stability claims at 72-hour mark in solution?

## Third-Party Verification Plan

1. **Lab partner:** Identify UK accredited analytical lab
2. **Certificate of Analysis:** Creatine content pre/post coffee
3. **Stability claim:** "X% potency preserved at Y temperature"
4. **Marketing use:** Build trust through transparency
