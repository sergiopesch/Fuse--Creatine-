# Market Position — FUSE Creatine

## Positioning Statement

For coffee-drinking fitness enthusiasts who want the proven benefits of creatine without the hassle, FUSE is the first coffee-optimised creatine that dissolves instantly in your morning cup — unlike standard creatine powders that don't dissolve in hot drinks and require a separate routine step.

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors (Creatine + Coffee)

**None identified in UK market.** FUSE would be first-to-market in the UK for a creatine product specifically designed for coffee.

### Indirect Competitors

| Competitor | Category | Price | Weakness vs FUSE |
|-----------|----------|-------|-------------------|
| MyProtein Creatine | Bulk powder | £12-15/83 servings | Doesn't dissolve in coffee, no convenience factor |
| Optimum Nutrition | Premium powder | £15-20/57 servings | Same dissolution issues |
| Thorne Creatine | Capsules | £30-35/90 servings | No coffee integration, premium but different UX |
| Beam Creatine | Flavoured powder | £30+/30 servings | Flavoured (alters coffee), US-focused |
| Coffee supplements (various) | Coffee + additives | Varies | Usually protein/collagen, not creatine |

### Adjacent Categories

- **Collagen coffee**: Growing category, proves market for "add to coffee" supplements
- **Mushroom coffee**: Four Sigmatic et al. prove premium coffee-supplement market exists
- **Protein coffee**: Shows athletes want supplements in their coffee

## Market Size

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|-------|
| UK supplement market | £1.5B | Mintel 2024 |
| UK creatine market | ~£100M (est.) | Industry estimates |
| UK coffee drinkers | 98M cups/day | British Coffee Association |
| Overlap (creatine users who drink coffee) | ~70% (est.) | Survey data |

## FUSE Advantages

1. **First mover**: No UK competitor in coffee-optimised creatine
2. **Routine integration**: Leverages existing daily habit
3. **Science-backed**: Creatine monohydrate is the gold standard
4. **Premium positioning**: Higher margins than commodity creatine
5. **Made in Britain**: Trust and quality signal for UK market

## Risks

1. **Patent landscape**: AnaBio holds micro-encapsulation patents (mitigated by FTO analysis)
2. **Market education**: Need to convince people creatine + coffee works
3. **Price sensitivity**: Premium pricing vs cheap bulk creatine
4. **Copycat risk**: Low barrier for established brands to copy (mitigated by first-mover + brand)

## Strategic Priorities

1. Establish "coffee-optimised creatine" category
2. Build brand before competitors enter
3. Secure IP where possible (trademark, potentially method patent)
4. Create content moat (SEO, education, community)
