# Product Brief — FUSE Creatine

## What Is FUSE?

FUSE Creatine is Britain's first coffee-optimised creatine supplement. It uses micro-encapsulated creatine monohydrate that dissolves instantly in hot coffee — no grit, no stirring, no taste change.

## The Problem

Creatine monohydrate is the world's most studied sports supplement, with 500+ peer-reviewed studies supporting its benefits. Yet most people either:
- Don't take it because it's inconvenient (mixing powder, gritty texture)
- Forget to take it (separate step from daily routine)
- Dislike the experience (chalky, doesn't dissolve)

Meanwhile, most adults already drink coffee every morning — a perfect daily habit to piggyback on.

## The Solution

FUSE micro-encapsulates creatine monohydrate so it:
- Dissolves in under 3 seconds in hot coffee
- Has zero impact on taste
- Requires no stirring
- Is heat-stable (creatine remains bioavailable)
- Comes in single-serve sachets for precise dosing

## Key Differentiators

| Taste impact | None | Gritty, chalky |
| Format | Individual sachets | Tub + scoop |
| Routine integration | Add to existing coffee | Separate step |
| Heat stability | ✅ Validated | Not designed for hot liquids |
