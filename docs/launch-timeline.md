## Critical Path

The critical path runs through Legal → R&D → Manufacturing:

```
FTO Analysis (Legal)
  → Encapsulation Method (R&D)
    → Supplier Selection (R&D)
      → Prototype (R&D)
        → Testing (R&D)
          → Manufacturing (R&D + Legal)
            → Launch
```

**Everything else (Marketing, Branding, Sales, Content) can proceed in parallel** but product availability is gated by this path.

## Key Risk: FTO Timeline

If FTO analysis takes 30+ days and reveals patent conflicts, the timeline extends significantly. Mitigation: Alternative encapsulation methods are pre-identified.
