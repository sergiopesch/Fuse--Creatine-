## Patents

### AnaBio Patent Landscape

AnaBio Technologies (Ireland) holds 14 patents related to micro-encapsulation of creatine. Key patents:

| Patent | Coverage | Risk Level |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Lipid-based micro-encapsulation for creatine | Method + composition | HIGH |
| Heat-stable creatine formulations | Method | MEDIUM |
| Various delivery system patents | Multiple methods | VARIES |

**Critical Action**: Commission Freedom-to-Operate (FTO) analysis before investing in formulation. Estimated cost: £10-25k. This is the highest priority legal action.

### Alternative Encapsulation Methods (Potentially Clear of AnaBio)

These methods have been identified as potentially not covered by AnaBio patents, but FTO analysis is required to confirm:

1. **Lipid-based encapsulation** — Using food-grade fats/waxes (some overlap risk)
2. **Cyclodextrin complexation** — Sugar-based molecular encapsulation
3. **Alginate/pectin shells** — Plant-based polysaccharide coating
4. **Spray-dried maltodextrin matrix** — Common in instant beverage industry
5. **Non-hydrolyzed protein sources** — Pea protein, rice protein, casein

### FUSE Patent Opportunities

| Opportunity | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Novel coffee-specific formulation | 📋 To assess after FTO | Could file if method is novel |
| Coffee-optimised dissolution method | 📋 To assess | Depends on final formulation |

## Trade Secrets

| Secret | Protection |
|--------|------------|
| Final formulation recipe | NDA with manufacturers |
| Supplier relationships | Confidential agreements |
| Pricing strategy | Internal only |
