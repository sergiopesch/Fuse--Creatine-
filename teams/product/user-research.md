# User Research — FUSE Creatine

## Target Users

### Primary: Coffee-Drinking Fitness Enthusiasts

**Profile**: Adults (25-45) who drink coffee daily and use creatine supplements. They find current creatine supplementation inconvenient (mixing with water, gritty texture, extra step in routine).

**Pain Points** (validated via social signals — see `research/validation/social-signals.md`):
- Creatine doesn't dissolve well in drinks
- Extra step in morning routine
- Gritty texture is unpleasant
- Forgetting to take creatine
- Don't want to carry separate supplement

**Desired Outcome**: Add creatine to their existing coffee habit seamlessly.

### Secondary: Health-Conscious Professionals

**Profile**: Adults (30-50) interested in cognitive and physical performance. May not currently use creatine but drink coffee daily.

**Pain Points**:
- Overwhelmed by supplement options
- Skeptical of supplement industry claims
- Want science-backed products
- Value convenience and premium quality

**Desired Outcome**: Simple, trustworthy way to add proven performance benefits to existing routine.

## Key Insights

1. **Routine integration is the #1 value proposition** — People already drink coffee daily. Removing friction is more compelling than adding benefits.

2. **Science credibility matters** — Target users are educated and skeptical. Peer-reviewed evidence and transparent sourcing build trust.

3. **Premium positioning is viable** — Willingness to pay premium for convenience and quality is high in this demographic.

4. **"Made in Britain" resonates** — British consumers value local manufacturing for supplements (trust, quality perception).
