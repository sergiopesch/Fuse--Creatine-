# Pricing Strategy — FUSE Creatine

## Positioning: Premium

FUSE is positioned as a premium, science-backed supplement. Pricing should reflect quality, innovation, and convenience — not compete on cost.

## Competitive Landscape

| Product | Type | Price | Servings | Per Serving |
|---------|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| MyProtein Creatine | Powder | £12-15 | 83 | £0.15-0.18 |
| Optimum Nutrition | Powder | £15-20 | 57 | £0.26-0.35 |
| Thorne Creatine | Capsules | £30-35 | 90 | £0.33-0.39 |
| FUSE Creatine | Sachets | TBD | TBD | TBD |

## Proposed D2C Pricing (Draft — CEO Approval Required)

### Option A: Premium Sachets
- 30 sachets (1 month): £29.99 (£1.00/serving)
- 90 sachets (3 months): £74.99 (£0.83/serving)
- Subscription (monthly): £24.99 (£0.83/serving)

### Option B: Mid-Premium
- 30 sachets (1 month): £24.99 (£0.83/serving)
- 90 sachets (3 months): £59.99 (£0.67/serving)
- Subscription (monthly): £19.99 (£0.67/serving)

## B2B Pricing

- Wholesale: 40-50% off retail
- White-label: TBD (post-launch consideration)
- Minimum order: TBD

## Key Considerations

1. **Cost of goods**: Micro-encapsulation adds cost vs plain creatine powder
2. **Sachet packaging**: Higher per-unit cost than tubs
3. **Premium positioning**: Price must signal quality, not commodity
4. **Subscription incentive**: Meaningful discount for recurring revenue

## Status

⚠️ **Pricing not finalized.** Awaiting:
- Final COGS from R&D (depends on formulation and supplier)
- CEO review and approval
- Market testing plan
