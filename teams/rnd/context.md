# R&D Team — Current Context

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-28
**Team Code**: R&D
**Orchestration Mode**: manual

## Current State

Scientific feasibility validated. Creatine stability in hot coffee confirmed (<5% degradation). Patent landscape analyzed — AnaBio has key patents, but alternative encapsulation methods available. Need FTO analysis before major formulation investment.

## Active Work

- [ ] Await FTO analysis results from Legal
- [ ] Evaluate alternative encapsulation methods
- [ ] Create supplier shortlist for creatine monohydrate
- [ ] Define prototype testing protocol

## Recent Completions

- ✅ Scientific feasibility assessment complete
- ✅ Creatine stability research documented
- ✅ Patent landscape analysis (14 AnaBio patents identified)
- ✅ Alternative encapsulation methods documented
- ✅ Market analysis with business projections

## Blockers

- **FTO Analysis**: CRITICAL — Cannot proceed with formulation investment until Legal completes Freedom-to-Operate analysis (risk: patent infringement)
- **Supplier samples**: Need to request samples from shortlisted suppliers

## Priorities

1. **CRITICAL**: Wait for FTO analysis before major investment
2. **HIGH**: Prepare supplier RFQ (Request for Quote)
3. **HIGH**: Document prototype specifications
4. **MEDIUM**: Plan stability testing protocol

## Formulation Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Creatine monohydrate | Sourcing | Multiple suppliers identified |
| Encapsulation method | Pending FTO | Alternatives to AnaBio patent documented |
| Carrier matrix | Research | Coffee-neutral options identified |
| Dissolution target | Defined | <3 seconds |

## Alternative Encapsulation Methods (Not Patented by AnaBio)

1. **Lipid-based encapsulation** — Using food-grade fats/waxes
2. **Cyclodextrin complexation** — Sugar-based molecular encapsulation
3. **Alginate/pectin shells** — Plant-based polysaccharide coating
4. **Spray-dried maltodextrin matrix** — Common in instant beverage industry
5. **Non-hydrolyzed protein sources** — Pea protein, rice protein, casein
