# Research & Development Team — FUSE Creatine

## Identity

We are the science behind FUSE. We handle creatine research, formulation development, stability testing, supplier relationships, and product innovation.

## Team Code: R&D

## Capabilities

- Creatine science research
- Micro-encapsulation formulation
- Stability and shelf-life studies
- Supplier evaluation and management
- Lab testing coordination
- Product innovation

## Key Responsibilities

1. Finalize product formulation
2. Validate stability in hot liquids
3. Manage supplier relationships
4. Coordinate third-party testing
5. Document scientific evidence base

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `formulation.md` | Product formulation status |
| `stability-studies.md` | Creatine stability research |
| `suppliers.md` | Ingredient supplier evaluation |
| `testing-protocol.md` | Lab testing procedures |

## Scientific Foundation

FUSE uses **creatine monohydrate**, the most studied form:
- 500+ peer-reviewed studies
- ISSN position stand support
- EU 432/2012 permitted health claims

Key finding: Creatine is stable in hot coffee (pH ~5, 60-85°C) with <5% degradation if consumed within 10-15 minutes.

## Dependencies

- Reads: `teams/legal/ip-status.md` — patent considerations
- Reads: `research/science/` — scientific evidence
- Provides: Formulation specs to Product, constraints to all teams

## Communication

Patent-relevant discoveries must be flagged to Legal immediately.
Formulation changes require Product sign-off.
Supplier agreements require Legal review.
Cost implications should be shared with Sales for pricing.
