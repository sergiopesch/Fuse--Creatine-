## Active Ingredient: Creatine Monohydrate

**Why monohydrate**:
- Most studied form (500+ peer-reviewed studies)
- ISSN recommended form
- EU 432/2012 permitted health claims apply
- Cost-effective
- Best safety profile

**Purity requirement**: ≥99.9% (Creapure grade or equivalent)

## Encapsulation Approach

**Status**: BLOCKED — Awaiting FTO analysis from Legal

The encapsulation method is the key technical differentiator. AnaBio Technologies holds patents on several micro-encapsulation methods for creatine. FUSE must use a method that does not infringe.

### Leading Alternatives (Post-FTO)

1. **Spray-dried maltodextrin matrix**
   - Pros: Common in instant beverages, low cost, well-understood
   - Cons: May affect sweetness slightly
   - Risk: LOW patent risk

2. **Cyclodextrin complexation**
   - Pros: Excellent dissolution, no taste, established food tech
   - Cons: Higher cost, may need specialized manufacturing
   - Risk: LOW patent risk

3. **Alginate/pectin shells**
   - Pros: Plant-based, clean label, good dissolution
   - Cons: pH-sensitive (coffee is acidic), needs optimization
   - Risk: LOW patent risk

## Carrier Matrix

The carrier matrix ensures the creatine integrates with coffee without affecting flavor. Options:

| Matrix | Coffee Compatibility | Cost | Complexity |
|--------|---------------------|------|------------|
| Maltodextrin | Good | Low | Low |
| Modified starch | Good | Low | Low |
| Inulin | Good | Medium | Low |
| Beta-cyclodextrin | Excellent | High | Medium |

## Next Steps (After FTO Clearance)

1. Select encapsulation method based on FTO results
2. Request supplier samples
3. Create prototype formulation
4. Conduct dissolution testing
5. Conduct taste testing
6. Stability testing (accelerated + real-time)
7. Scale-up with manufacturing partner

## Dependencies

- Legal: FTO analysis MUST clear before proceeding
- Product: Dose (3g vs 5g) must be confirmed
- Sales: COGS target for pricing
- Branding: Packaging dimensions affect sachet design
