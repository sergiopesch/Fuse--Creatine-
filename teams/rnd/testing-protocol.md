# Testing Protocol — FUSE Creatine

## Status: Draft

Testing protocol is defined but cannot begin until prototype formulation is ready (blocked by FTO analysis).

## Phase 1: Prototype Validation

### Test 1: Dissolution Performance

**Objective**: Verify product dissolves in <3 seconds in hot coffee.

| Parameter | Condition |
|-----------|-----------|
| Coffee type | Standard brewed coffee (filter, espresso) |
| Temperature | 60°C, 70°C, 80°C |
| Method | Add sachet contents, start timer, record full dissolution |
| Pass criteria | <3 seconds at all temperatures |
| Replicates | n=10 per condition |

### Test 2: Taste Impact

**Objective**: Verify zero detectable taste change.

| Parameter | Condition |
|-----------|-----------|
| Method | Double-blind triangle test |
| Panel size | Minimum 20 participants |
| Comparison | Coffee with FUSE vs coffee without |
| Pass criteria | No statistically significant taste difference (p>0.05) |

### Test 3: Creatine Content Retention

**Objective**: Verify creatine remains bioavailable in coffee.

| Parameter | Condition |
|-----------|-----------|
| Method | HPLC analysis |
| Timepoints | 0, 5, 10, 15, 30 minutes after adding to coffee |
| Temperature | 70°C, 80°C |
| Pass criteria | >95% creatine retained at 15 minutes |

## Phase 2: Stability Testing

### Test 4: Accelerated Shelf Life

| Condition | Duration | Measurements |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 40°C / 75% RH | 3, 6 months | Creatine content, moisture, appearance |
| 25°C / 60% RH | 6, 12 months | Creatine content, moisture, appearance |

**Pass criteria**: >95% creatine retained, no clumping, no off-odors.

### Test 5: Package Integrity

| Test | Method | Pass Criteria |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Moisture ingress | Weight gain over time | <0.5% gain at 6 months |
| Seal integrity | Vacuum leak test | No leaks |
| Drop test | 1m drop, all orientations | No sachet rupture |

## Phase 3: Batch Quality (Manufacturing)

### Per-Batch Testing

| Test | Method | Specification |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Creatine content | HPLC | Label claim ±5% |
| Heavy metals | ICP-MS | Below EU limits |
| Microbiology | Standard plate count | <1000 CFU/g |
| Moisture | Karl Fischer | <5% |

## Third-Party Testing Labs (To Identify)

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| ISO 17025 accredited | Required for regulatory compliance |
| Food supplement testing experience | Required |
| UK-based | Preferred |
| HPLC capability | Required for creatine assay |

## Dependencies

- R&D: Prototype formulation must be ready
- Legal: FTO must clear before prototype investment
- Sales: Budget for testing (~£5-15k estimated)
